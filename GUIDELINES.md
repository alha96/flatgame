# flatgame

A project to better organize a shared flat!

### The idea

This web app can be used to organize a shared community. The basic concept is the following:
Instead of having a tight configuration, when who and what needs to be done by the members of a community, everyboday can simply choose, what he/she wants to do and then get points in order to honour the effort. 

### Technical background

MEAN architecture: MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular 4, NodeJS

## The web app and its functions

### Activities

Each activity is simply a "task", which has a name, a description, a certain amount of points and a period of time (until it should be done again). Activities have more points, if the take more time to complete or if they are uncomfortable.
Here is a list of some activities (amount of points in brackets):

Weekly:
Bathroom (8)
WC (6)
Kitchenfloor (4)
Corridor (2)

Monthly:
Clean fridge (3) / stove (2) / oven (3) / rest of kitchen (4) / terrace (3)

As needed:
Dishwasher (1) / biowaste (2) / (yellow) plastic bag (2)


## Functions

### Sign up 

The user can sign in on the web page (using the Google Account).

### Set up

Then you have to join an existing flat. If there wasn't created one, this needs to be done. The user can invited his room mates.

### Create activities

Afterwards you can create activities and modify them as you like. There will be some standard activities, which can be used.

### Strt the game!

If everything is set up properly, the "game" starts. You can do an activity and get points for it. All points are summarized, which shows the current state of all members. 

### Special features

Reminder to people, which are a lot behind the other members.
